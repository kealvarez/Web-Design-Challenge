# Web-Design-Challenge

## Background
Data becomes more powerful when you share it with others! That’s because people can use your data only if they can access it. So, you’ll use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

## Instructions
Create a website by using either the visualizations that you created for your Python-APIs Challenge or the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge. To do so, use the considerations and website requirements that the following subsections describe. Also, ensure that your repository has regular commits and a descriptive README.md file.

### Considerations
- Be aware that you must use Bootstrap. This includes using the Bootstrap navbar component for the header on every page, the Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page, and the Bootstrap table component for the data page.

- Be aware that you must deploy your website to GitHub Pages, and that as a result, the website must work at a live, publicly accessible URL.

- Make sure to use a CSS media query that uses Bootstrap and/or @media for the navigation bar.

- Make sure that your website works at all window widths.

- Feel free to take some liberties with the visual aspects, but keep the core functionality the same as the instructions describe. (For example, keep the comparison visualizations on the comparison page.)
